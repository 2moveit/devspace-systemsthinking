# What is Systems Thinking?

* is the ability or skill to perform problem solving in complex system
* Systems thinking is your ability to see things as a whole (or holistically) including the many different types of relationships between the many elements in a complex system.

> The same old thinking will create the same old results, thus we need to start by changing our way of thinking and looking at the world.

# The Seven Learning Disabilities

1. I am my position.
2. “The enemy Is out there” syndrome.
3. The illusion of taking charge.
4. Fixation on events. 
5. The Parable of the Boiled Frog.
6. The delusion of learning from experience.
7. The myth of the management team.

# Current Reality Tree

...is a tool to **analyze** many systems or organizational problems at once. By **identifying root causes** common to most or all of the problems, a CRT can greatly aid focused improvement of the system. A current reality tree is a **directed graph**.

# Undesirable Effects (UDE)

“An UDE is essentially the first indication you have that something might be amiss in the system. It is something that really exists and is negative on its own merits.” – William Dettmer, The Logical Thinking Processes, 2007

  * Employee morale is low
  * Decreasing profit

# What is a Mental Model?

A mental model is an **explanation of how something works**. The phrase “mental model” is an overarching term for any sort of concept, framework, or worldview that you carry around in your mind.

Mental models help you **understand life**.

# Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD)

![bg right](drawings/cld.example.population.0.drawio.svg)
aid in visualizing how different variables in a system are causally interrelated. The diagram consists of a set of words and arrows. Causal loop diagrams are accompanied by a narrative which describes the causally closed situation the CLD describes.

# CLD - Building a CLD - Before you start

Source: [Systems Thinking mit Causal-Loop-Diagrammen](https://agilecoach.de/wissen/systems-thinking-mit-causal-loop-diagrammen/)

* What are the aspects and boundaries of the system in focus?
* What's the detail level we want to look at?

* ➡️ Don't try to build "the whole system" from the beginning
* Which problem are we looking at with the model to be created?

> Example: "We observe again and again that we have to push a lot of short-cycle hotfixes after each release. This causes a lot of stress in the teams and our users are obviously not really satisfied either. Let's try to model these problems in a causal loop diagram."

---

# Building a CLD (1) - Identify System Variables

* What variables are there in our system that might have something to do with our problem?
* ➡️ Be precise in naming the variables, ideally make them quantitative

![](drawings/cld.exercise.1.drawio.svg)

---

# Building a CLD (2) - Dynamics and changes of system variables

* What relationship can be established between individual system variables?
* Do two system variables influence each other directly or are other variables involved?
* Which other aspects play a role in the environment of an identified variable?

![](drawings/cld.exercise.2.drawio.svg)

---

# Building a CLD (3) - Reinforcement and weakening of system variables

* If variable A changes upward, that is, becomes stronger, higher, or more in its expression, how does variable B change?

![](drawings/cld.exercise.3.drawio.svg)

---

# Building a CLD (4) - Delayed influence of system variables

* Add additional influences, causes and identify delays in the process
